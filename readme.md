**Hyde** is just a _really_ basic [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)-based site. To keep it really simple, Hyde **doesn't use Markdown, SCSS, or any of that fancy stuff**. You can use them if you want to, but Hyde won't force technologies down your throat. Keeps it _basic_, y'know?

If you _do_ fork/use Hyde:
1. I recommend GitHub Pages to host it
2. Look at the code. It's deliberately simple - don't be scared.
3. Make it look nicer - check out `css/style.css`
